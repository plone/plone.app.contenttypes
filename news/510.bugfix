Various fixes for restoring references:

- Migrate ``relatesTo`` AT relation to ``relatedItems`` DX relation.
- In DX check the schema to see if relation field is list or item.
  Taken over from `collective.relationhelpers <https://github.com/collective/collective.relationhelpers/>`_.
- ``restore_references``: accept ``relationship_fieldname_mapping`` argument.
  This must be a dictionary with a relationship name as key and fieldname as value, instead of always using ``relatedItems`` as fieldname.
