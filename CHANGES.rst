    Taken over from `collective.relationhelpers <https://github.com/collective/collective.relationhelpers/>`_.

  (#511)


2.0.1 (2019-02-13)
------------------

Bug fixes:


- Following the rename of the lead image and rich text behaviors, use the new
  setting of plone.behavior to register their ``former_dotted_names``, so that
  consumers that have stored the old dotted name have a chance of recovering.
  This is especially needed for plone.app.versioningbehavior, see `issue
  <https://github.com/plone/plone.app.versioningbehavior/pull/45>` [pysailor]
  (#480)

2.0.0 (2018-10-30)
------------------

Breaking changes:

- ILeadImage and IRichText behaviors now have proper "Marker"-Interfaces.
  As this was only possible by renaming the schema adapter to *Behavior* to
  not break with implementations inside the collective, the FTI-behavior-definition
  has changed:

  - ``plone.app.contenttypes.behaviors.leadimage.ILeadImage``
    becomes
    ``plone.app.contenttypes.behaviors.leadimage.ILeadImageBehavior``
    and
  - ``plone.app.contenttypes.behaviors.richtext.IRichText``
    becomes
    ``plone.app.contenttypes.behaviors.richtext.IRichTextBehavior``

  [iham]

New features:

- By using correct (Marker-)Interfaces for the ILeadImage and IRichText,
  the factories are now working properly and can be reconfigured
  wherever you might need them. ZCA FTW!
  [iham]
- Use human_readable_size from Products.CMFPlone.utils to replace getObjSize
  script. #1801
  [reinhardt]

Bug fixes:

- The ``Format`` accessor should actually return the ``format`` attribute
  (see plone/Products.CMFPlone#2540)
  [ale-rt]

- Fix resource warnings.
  [davisagli]

1.4.12 (2018-09-23)
-------------------

Breaking changes:

- ILeadImage and IRichText behaviors now have proper "Marker"-Interfaces.
  As this was only possible by renaming the schema adapter to *Behavior* to
  not break with implementations inside the collective, the FTI-behavior-definition
  has changed:

  - ``plone.app.contenttypes.behaviors.leadimage.ILeadImage``
    becomes
    ``plone.app.contenttypes.behaviors.leadimage.ILeadImageBehavior``
    and
  - ``plone.app.contenttypes.behaviors.richtext.IRichText``
    becomes
    ``plone.app.contenttypes.behaviors.richtext.IRichTextBehavior``

  [iham]

New features:

- By using correct (Marker-)Interfaces for the ILeadImage and IRichText,
  the factories are now working properly and can be reconfigured
  wherever you might need them. ZCA FTW!
  [iham]

Bug fixes:

- Fix folder layout property migration. The default listing_view layout was
  always set if a folder didn't have a layout property.
  Also a default_page property could be inherited from parent folders or
  the Plone Siteroot, causing 'front-page' default_pages on many folders.
  Now only a direct layout property is copied and in that case on the local
  default_page if set is copied again.
  see `issue 444 <https://github.com/plone/plone.app.contenttypes/issues/444>`
  [fredvd]

- Fixed false implemented Factories and Markers for ILeadImage and IRichText.
  see `issue 457 <https://github.com/plone/plone.app.contenttypes/issues/476>`
  [iham]

- Fixed Tests for collection and migration.
  see `issue <https://github.com/plone/plone.app.contenttypes/issues/477>`

  [iham]

- pep8 cleanup.
  [iham]

- Fix various issues in py3

  [davisagli]

- check if a contentrule exists before assignment on migration
  [MrTango]


1.4.10 (2018-04-03)
-------------------

New features:

  Other addons can check for that and handle accordingly.
  [thet]

  [hvelarde]

- Do not encode query strings on internal link redirections;
  fixes `issue 457 <https://github.com/plone/plone.app.contenttypes/issues/457>`_.
  [hvelarde]

- Migrations:

  - Handle ignore catalog errors where a brain can't find it's object.
  - Try to delete the layout attribute before setting the layout.

  [mrsaicharan1]


1.4.8 (2018-02-05)
------------------

Bug fixes:

- Do not use ``portal_quickinstaller`` in the migration form.
  Use ``get_installer`` to check if ``plone.app.contenttypes`` is
  installed or installable.  Use ``portal_setup`` directly for
  blacklisting the ``type_info`` step when installing our profile.
  [maurits]

- Add Python 2 / 3 compatibility
  [pbauer]


1.4.7 (2017-12-14)

  [thet]

- Remove obsolete HAS_MULTILINGUAL from utils.
  [pbauer]

  [davisagli]


1.4.3 (2017-08-30)
------------------

Bug fixes:

- Disable queuing of indexing-operations (PLIP https://github.com/plone/Products.CMFPlone/issues/1343)
  during migration to Dexterity to prevent catalog-errors.
  [pbauer]


1.4.2 (2017-08-27)
------------------

New features:

- Index default values when indexing the file fails due to a missing binary.
  [pbauer]

- Allow to skip rebuilding the catalog when migrating at to dx in code.
  [pbauer]

Bug fixes:

- Add translation namesspace and i18n:translate to the dexterity schema
  definitions for the content types that have extra field defined on top of the
  behavior composition. Otherwise no translations can be picked up.
  [fredvd]

- Use original raw text and mimetype when indexing rich text.
  This avoids a double transform (raw source to output mimetype to plain text).
  Includes a reindex of the SearchableText index for Collections, Documents and News Items.
  `Issue 2066 <https://github.com/plone/Products.CMFPlone/issues/2066>`_.
  [maurits]

- Migrate the richtext-field 'text' when migrating ATTopics to Collections.
  [pbauer]

  See issue https://github.com/plone/plone.app.contenttypes/issues/362
  [maurits]

- Remove ``path`` index injection in "plone.collection" behaviors ``results`` method.
  It is a duplicate.
  Exactly the same is done already in the ``plone.app.querybuilder.querybuilder._makequery``,
  which is called by above ``results`` method.
  [jensens]

  This was looked up for contentmenu/toolbar at every authenticated request.
  It also had side effects if custom collection behaviors are used.
  [jensens]

- Fixed unstable robot test for location criterion.  [maurits]

- Don't fail for ``utils.replace_link_variables_by_paths``, if value is ``None``.
  The value can be ``None`` when creating a ``Link`` type with ``invokeFactory`` without ``remoteUrl`` set and calling the indexer before setting the URL.

  several content types.
  [thet]
